Git Hub Tutorial
Chloe here, I am taking on a new challenge of learning coding. I realized that I was in for this fully because I took 
listening to astrology podcasts to ease my suffering while working last year. I found that yesterday, and today I seem to
be so deeply focused and willing myself to concentrate that I am actually putting off the listening marathon for the gym.
I also discovered that
I have a sense of protection around my life now that I wasn't aware I so easily gave away in the past.
I do know that I feel and sense others thoughts- but for what seems like the first time I actively can block those out
which conveys a far deeper ability to share. I only hope I will maintain my sense of purpose as things move forward.
